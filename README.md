🏃 GitHub Runner Auto-Start Setup (Ubuntu)
This guide explains how to configure the run.sh script to run continuously and automatically after reboot using systemd.

📁 Prerequisites
Ubuntu system with systemd (default in most distributions).

GitHub Actions self-hosted runner already configured.

Script located at: /home/ubuntu/run.sh

⚙️ 1. Create the systemd Service
Create a new systemd unit file:

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/github-runner.service
Paste the following content:

[Unit]
Description=GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runner
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/actions-runner/run.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/actions-runner
User=ubuntu
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
Environment=RUNNER_MANUALLY_TRAP_SIG=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target



✅ Make sure the paths (ExecStart, WorkingDirectory) are accurate for your environment.

🔐 2. Make the Script Executable

chmod +x /home/ubuntu/actions-runner/run.sh

🔄 3. Enable and Start the Service
Run the following commands to enable the service to start on boot and start it now:

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable github-runner.service
sudo systemctl start github-runner.service


✅ 4. Verify the Service
Check if the runner is active:

sudo systemctl status github-runner.service
Expected output should show the status as active (running).

💡 Notes
Restart=always ensures the script restarts if it crashes.

RUNNER_MANUALLY_TRAP_SIG=1 helps the script handle shutdown signals gracefully.

📌 Troubleshooting
Use journalctl -u github-runner.service -f to see live logs.

Ensure no sudo commands inside the script block automatic execution as ubuntu user.

Confirm networking is available (runner needs internet access).

🧹 To Remove the Service
sudo systemctl stop github-runner.service
sudo systemctl disable github-runner.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/github-runner.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
